# Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability-CVE-2024-38063

Microsoft recently advised of a critical TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability dubbed CVE 2024-38063, which is a critical unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability within the Windows TCP/IP stack. The flaw can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on systems with IPv6 (which is enabled by default), without any user interaction. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.8.

CVE 2024-38063 affects Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2008 through 2022.

All versions of Windows that have IPv6 enabled are at risk, which encompasses nearly all modern Windows deployments​.
## Potential impact of CVE 2024-38063

If successfully exploited, attackers could gain SYSTEM-level access and thus:
  
  •Execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

  •Compromise sensitive data.

  •Install malware or perform other malicious actions, leading to full system control.

  
## Steps to mitigate the vulnerability
Although there is currently no known exploit code, Microsoft tags this vulnerability as likely to be exploited. Because of the severity and criticality of a possible exploitation, this vulnerability requires immediate action.

  •	Update Windows systems: Administrators should prioritize applying all the relevant Windows patches to protect against this critical vulnerability.

  •	Disable IPv6 if updating is not possible: For systems where patching is not immediately possible, disabling IPv6 will reduce the attack surface. However, this may disrupt network services that rely on IPv6, so it should be done cautiously​. Also, this is only a short-term solution. For long-term protection, the latest security updates should be applied​.

  •	Monitor for anomalous events: Perform ongoing monitoring for unusual IPv6 network traffic.
